<<<<< Dunes 2 Wallpaper, by dpcdpc11 in http://bit.ly/2l36LCp >>>>>

If you enjoy my wallpapers, please consider buying me a cup of coffee: www.paypal.me/dpcdpc11

Here's a new wallpaper I've been working on while dabbling in Affinity Designer, which turns out to be a pretty cool and useful piece of software!

This one is inspired by the Star Wars planet Tatooine where a group of scouts are looking for a fugitive running away from something.
Let's face it... deep inside we are all runners after all. What are you running from?

Anyway I hope you like it. Don't forget to try all 5 variations (with and without type) and let me know which one you like best because feedback is always welcome!

Hope you like them and... ENJOY!

<<<<< Change for Kibojoe Linux 18.02 >>>>>

kind regards,
